# CS50P Portfolio

Welcome to my CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python repository! Here, you'll find a collection of the problem sets that I've completed as part of the course. Each problem set is located in its respective directory.

## Introduction
I am Iyke Omozusi, and I have embarked on the CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python journey with the goal of enhancing my proficiency in Python programming. This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my journey, documenting the skills I have honed and the progress I have made throughout the course."

## Problem Sets

- [Problem Set 0](./problem_sets/problem_set0): Functions, Variables

- [Problem Set 1](./problem_sets/problem_set1): Conditionals

- [Problem Set 2](./problem_sets/problem_set2): Loops

- [Problem Set 3](./problem_sets/problem_set3): Exceptions

- [Problem Set 4](./problem_sets/problem_set4): Libraries

- [Problem Set 5](./problem_sets/problem_set5): Unit Tests

- [Problem Set 6](./problem_sets/problem_set6): File I/O

- [Problem Set 7](./problem_sets/problem_set7): Regular Expressions (Regexes)

- [Problem Set 8](./problem_sets/problem_set8): Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Contributions
Throughout this course, I've learned valuable skills in problem-solving, algorithm design, and coding in Python. I've documented my solutions in the individual README files within each problem set directory.

Feel free to explore my work and see how I tackled the challenges presented in the course. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect.

## About Me

I love to code and continue to learn and explore new technologies. This repository showcases my progress in Python programming through the Havard's CS50P course. Feel free to explore the codes, provide feedback, or reach out for collaboration opportunities.
