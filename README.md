# My-CS50-Python-Programming-Journey

Welcome to my CS50 Python programming journey repository! Here, I document my progress and showcase the Python projects and problem sets I've worked on during my introductory Python programming course.

## Problem Sets

### Problem Set 0
- [indoor.py](./problem_sets/problem_set0/indoor.py)
  a.  Task: Implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged.
- [playback.py](./problem_sets/problem_set0/playback.py)
  a.  Task: Implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).
