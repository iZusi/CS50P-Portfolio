# CS50P Portfolio

Welcome to my CS50 Introduction to Python Programming project repository! Here, you'll find a collection of the problem sets that I've completed as part of the course. Each problem set is located in its respective directory.

## Problem Sets

### Problem Set 0 - Week 0 (Functions, Variables)
- [problem_set0](./problem_sets/problem_set0)

### Problem Set 1 - Week 1 (Conditionals)
- [problem_set1](./problem_sets/problem_set1)

### Problem Set 2 - Week 2 (Loops)
- [problem_set2](./problem_sets/problem_set2)

### Problem Set 3 - Week 3 (Exceptions)
- [problem_set3](./problem_sets/problem_set3)

### Problem Set 4 - Week 4 (Libraries)
- [problem_set4](./problem_sets/problem_set4)

### Problem Set 5 - Week 5 (Unit Tests)
- [problem_set5](./problem_sets/problem_set5)

### Problem Set 6 - Week 6 (File I/O)
- [problem_set6](./problem_sets/problem_set6)

### Problem Set 7 - Week 7 (Regular Expressions)
- [problem_set7](./problem_sets/problem_set7)
