### Problem Set 5 - Week 5 (Unit Tests)

- [twttr.py](./test_twttr/twttr.py):  Restructured my earlier program (twttr.py) from Problem Set 2 to allow for testing
- [test_twttr.py](./test_twttr/test_twttr.py):  In 'test_twttr.py,' several functions, all starting with "test_," assess the 'shorten' function's implementation within the 'twttr' module. Using 'pytest test_twttr.py,' these tests are efficiently executed to ensure the 'shorten' function's accuracy and compliance with module requirements.
  
- [bank.py](./test_bank/bank.py):  Restructured my program (bank.py) from Problem Set 1 to allow for testing
- [test_bank.py](./test_bank/test_bank.py):  Implemented a testing framework with functions prefixed by "test_" to thoroughly assess the 'bank' module's implementation. Executed the tests using 'pytest test_bank.py' to comprehensively verify code correctness and reliability.
