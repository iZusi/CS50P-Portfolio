### Problem Set 0 - Week 0 (Functions, Variables)
- [indoor.py](./indoor.py):  Here, I implemented a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. The code takes the user input, converts it to lowercase, removes leading and trailing whitespace, and then prints the modified input.
  
- [playback.py](./playback.py):  Here, I implemented a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods). My code takes the user input, removes leading/trailing whitespace, and replaces all spaces with three consecutive periods ('...') before printing the modified input.
  
- [faces.py](./faces.py):  I created a program with two functions. The first, called convert, accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to üôÇ (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any :( converted to üôÅ (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). The second, called main, that prompts the user for input, calls 'convert' on that input, and prints the result.
  
- [einstein.py](./einstein.py):  Here, I wrote a simple program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer.
  
- [tip.py](./tip.py):  This code calculates and prints the tip amount based on user input for meal cost and tip percentage. The code includes functions to convert dollar and percentage strings to floats for calculations.
