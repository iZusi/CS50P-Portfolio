### Problem Set 8 - Week 8 (Object-oriented Programming)

- [seasons.py](./seasons/seasons.py):  This Python code validates and converts a user's input for their date of birth in the format "YYYY-MM-DD." It uses regular expressions to check the input's format. If the input is valid, it calculates the user's age in minutes by comparing the birthdate to the current date and then converts this age into words using the "inflect" library. The result is displayed in words in American date format (e.g., "Two thousand three hundred forty-five minutes"). The user is prompted to enter their birthdate, and the code provides the age in minutes in words.
