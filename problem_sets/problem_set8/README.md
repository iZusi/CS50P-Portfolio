### Problem Set 8 - Week 8 (Object-oriented Programming)

- [seasons.py](./seasons/seasons.py):  This module validates and converts a user's input for their date of birth in the format "YYYY-MM-DD." It uses regular expressions to check the input's format. If the input is valid, it calculates the user's age in minutes by comparing the birthdate to the current date and then converts this age into words using the `inflect` library.
  
- [test_seasons.py](./seasons/test_seasons.py):  This code conducts two concise tests using the `pytest` framework for a function named `get_birthday` from the `seasons` module. The first test verifies that the function correctly converts "2000-01-01" to its equivalent age in minutes, expressed in words. The second test checks if the function raises a "SystemExit" exception when provided with an invalid date format like '01-01-2021.' These tests ensure the proper functionality of the `get_birthday` function and its handling of invalid inputs.

- [jar.py](./jar/jar.py):  This Python code defines a `Jar` class, which simulates a cookie jar with a default capacity of 12 cookies. You can deposit and withdraw cookies, but withdrawing fewer than 3 cookies raises an exception. The code then creates a "cookies" instance of the class, deposits 5 cookies, withdraws 2 cookies, and prints the jar's state after each operation.

- [test_jar.py](./jar/test_jar.py):  This code uses pytest to test a Python class called `Jar` The `test_init` function checks if a new jar instance starts with a default capacity of 12 cookies and has 0 cookies. The `test_str` function tests the string representation of the jar after depositing cookies. The `test_deposit` and `test_withdraw` functions verify that the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods correctly raise `ValueErrors` for exceeding the capacity or withdrawing more cookies than available. These tests ensure the `Jar` class functions as expected in various scenarios.
