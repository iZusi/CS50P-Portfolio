### Problem Set 8 - Week 8 (Object-oriented Programming)

- [seasons.py](./seasons/seasons.py):  This module validates and converts a user's input for their date of birth in the format "YYYY-MM-DD." It uses regular expressions to check the input's format. If the input is valid, it calculates the user's age in minutes by comparing the birthdate to the current date and then converts this age into words using the `inflect` library.
