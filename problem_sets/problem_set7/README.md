### Problem Set 7 - Week 7 (Regular Expressions)

- [numb3r.py](./numb3rs/numb3rs.py):  This program implements a function named `validate` that operates as follows: it expects an IPv4 address in the form of a string as input and then returns 'True' if the provided input is a valid IPv4 address; otherwise, it returns 'False.' The primary purpose of this function is to validate IPv4 addresses and determine their validity based on the input provided.
- [test_numb3rs.py](./numb3rs/test_numb3rs.py):  In 'test_numb3rs.py,' two functions, both starting with "test_," assess the `validate` function's implementation within the `numb3rs` module. Using 'pytest test_twttr.py,' these tests are executed to ensure the function's accuracy and compliance with module requirements.
  
- [watch.py](./watch/watch.py):  This code utilizes the `re` library to extract a YouTube video URL from an HTML snippet. The `parse` function searches for the first matching URL and generates the 'youtu.be' equivalent. In the `main` function, it prompts the user for HTML input and prints the extracted URL. The code offers a simple way to convert embedded YouTube video URLs to 'youtu.be' format within HTML.

- [working.py](./working/working.py):  This code converts time from a 12-hour clock format (with AM/PM indicators) to a 24-hour format. It uses regex to validate and parse the input time string, ensuring it adheres to the expected format. The `convert` function handles validation, and if the input is valid, it invokes the `convert_to_24` function to perform the conversion. The `main` function prompts the user for input, performs the conversion, and prints the result. If the input format is incorrect, it exits with a `ValueError` message.
- [test_working.py](./working/test_working.py):  This code features pytest test cases for two functions: `convert_to_24` and `convert`. `test_convert_to_24` assesses time format conversions, covering both valid and invalid inputs. `test_convert` validates the `convert` function, addressing various input scenarios and handling exceptions for error cases to ensure code robustness.
- [um.py](./um/um.py):  This module, with the help of a function called `count`, counts the occurrences of the word "um" as a standalone word in a given text. It is case-insensitive and doesn't count "um" as part of another word. For example, "hello, um, world" returns 1, and "yummy" returns 0.
- [test_um.py](./um/test_um.py):  This module features pytest cases for a function: `count`. The purpose of these test cases is to confirm that the `count` function from the `um` module behaves as expected for different inputs, especially regarding the case insensitivity and counting "um" as a standalone word.
