### Problem Set 1 - Week 1 (Conditionals)
- [deep.py](./deep.py):  Here, I implemented a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two.
  
- [bank.py](./bank.py):  This code takes the user's greeting input, processes it to determine an appropriate response, and prints a corresponding monetary value based on certain conditions.
  
- [extensions.py](./extensions.py):  This program takes the user's input for a file name, analyzes the file extension, and prints a corresponding MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) type based on the recognized extensions. If no recognized extension is found, it defaults to 'application/octet-stream' as a generic binary file type.
  
- [interpreter.py](./interpreter.py):  Here, I implemented a code takes a mathematical expression from the user, splits it into its components (operands and operator), and then performs the corresponding mathematical operation based on the operator, rounding the result to one decimal place. It also handles the division by zero error if the operator is '/', displaying "Math Error!" in that case.
  
- [meal.py](./meal.py):  Here, I implemented a program to determine mealtime based on user input in 24-hour time format (e.g., #:## or ##:##). The program identifies whether it's breakfast time, lunchtime, or dinnertime and outputs the respective mealtime. If it's not a mealtime, the program does not provide any output. It assumes that each meal's time range is inclusive. For instance, if the time is 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, it is considered breakfast time.
